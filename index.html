        <p>Heyyyy my name is Maddy Puryear

        <p>I want to be a game dev in the future ( or research alternate dimensions)</p>
        <p>I've discovered an intrest in dimensions (math and the scifi trope) and an intrest in "imaginary" numbers. 
        The fact that something unseeable, something on a different plane, can effect our own. It's intresting!</p>
        <p>Playing video games is a good escape. You can do whatever you want and be whoever you want. I'd like 
        to design an exprience that others can escape to. Though I would like people to balance game, work, and life more.</p>
